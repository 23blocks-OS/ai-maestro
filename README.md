## The Problem

You're using Claude Code for backend, Aider for frontend, and Cursor for docs. Each in its own terminal window. Each in a different tmux pane. You're constantly switching contexts, losing track of which agent is where, and your terminal tabs look like chaos.

## The Solution

![AI Maestro Dashboard](./docs/images/aiteam-web.png)

AI Maestro gives you one beautiful web dashboard for all your AI coding agents. Click between sessions instantly. Organize them hierarchically. Take notes. Never lose track again.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install & Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/23blocks-OS/ai-maestro.git
cd ai-maestro
yarn install
```

**Configure tmux for optimal scrolling** (highly recommended):
```bash
./scripts/setup-tmux.sh
```

This enables:
- ‚úÖ Mouse wheel scrolling (works with Claude Code's alternate screen)
- ‚úÖ 50,000 line scrollback buffer (up from 2,000)
- ‚úÖ Better terminal colors

**Configure SSH for tmux sessions** (CRITICAL for git operations):
```bash
# Add to ~/.tmux.conf
echo '
# SSH Agent Configuration - AI Maestro
set-option -g update-environment "DISPLAY SSH_ASKPASS SSH_AGENT_PID SSH_CONNECTION WINDOWID XAUTHORITY"
set-environment -g '"'"'SSH_AUTH_SOCK'"'"' ~/.ssh/ssh_auth_sock
' >> ~/.tmux.conf

# Add to ~/.zshrc (or ~/.bashrc)
echo '
# SSH Agent for tmux - AI Maestro
if [ -S "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ] && [ ! -h "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ]; then
    mkdir -p ~/.ssh
    ln -sf "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ~/.ssh/ssh_auth_sock
fi
' >> ~/.zshrc

# Create initial symlink and reload tmux config
mkdir -p ~/.ssh && ln -sf "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ~/.ssh/ssh_auth_sock
tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf 2>/dev/null || true
```

This ensures:
- ‚úÖ SSH keys work in all tmux sessions
- ‚úÖ Git operations work without permission errors
- ‚úÖ SSH persists across system restarts

**Start the dashboard**:
```bash
yarn dev
```

Dashboard opens at `http://localhost:23000`

**Network Access:** By default, AI Maestro is accessible on your local network at port 23000. See [Security](#security) below for important information.

**‚ö†Ô∏è After System Restart:** tmux and the dashboard won't auto-start by default. To avoid socket errors after restart, see [Auto-start Setup Guide](./docs/OPERATIONS-GUIDE.md#services-not-running-after-restart-most-common) for one-time configuration using macOS LaunchAgents and pm2.

**Optional: Configure settings**
```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local to customize:
# - HOSTNAME: Change to 'localhost' for local-only access
# - ENABLE_LOGGING: Set to 'true' to enable session logging
# See the Security and Configuration sections below for all options
```

### 2. Create Your First Session

**Option A: From the UI** (Recommended)

1. Click the **"+" button** in the sidebar
2. Enter a session name using hyphens for hierarchy:
   - Simple: `my-project`
   - Organized: `myproject-backend-api` (creates 3 levels)
3. Choose your working directory
4. Click "Create Agent"
5. Start your AI agent in the terminal that appears

**Option B: From Terminal** (For tmux users)

```bash
# In another terminal
cd ~/my-project
tmux new-session -s myproject-backend-api

# Start your AI agent (claude, aider, cursor, copilot, etc.)
claude

# Detach: Ctrl+B then D
```

> **üí° Hierarchy Tip**: Session names with hyphens create automatic organization:
> - `project-backend` ‚Üí 2 levels (project > backend)
> - `project-backend-api` ‚Üí 3 levels (project > backend > api)
> - Each top level gets its own color automatically!

### 3. Start Coding

Your session is now live in the dashboard. Click to switch between sessions. Add notes. Organize your work. That's it.

---

## üì¨ Inter-Agent Communication

**The next evolution in AI pair programming:** Your agents can now talk to each other.

When you're running a `backend-architect` agent and a `frontend-developer` agent, they need to coordinate. The backend agent finishes an API endpoint and needs to notify the frontend agent. The frontend agent hits an error and needs help from the backend team. Previously, you were the middleman - copying messages, switching contexts, losing flow.

**Not anymore.**

### How It Works

AI Maestro provides a **dual-channel messaging system** designed specifically for agent-to-agent communication:

#### 1. File-Based Messaging (Persistent & Structured)

Perfect for detailed requests, specifications, and async collaboration:

```bash
# Backend agent tells frontend agent: "API is ready"
send-aimaestro-message.sh frontend-dev \
  "GET /api/users endpoint ready" \
  "Endpoint implemented at routes/users.ts:45. Returns paginated user list. Supports ?page=1&limit=20" \
  normal \
  response
```

**Features:**
- **Priorities**: `urgent` | `high` | `normal` | `low`
- **Types**: `request` | `response` | `notification` | `update`
- **Inbox**: Each agent has their own inbox (Messages tab in UI)
- **Persistent**: Messages saved to `~/.aimaestro/messages/inbox/`
- **Searchable**: Filter by priority, type, sender, or content

#### 2. Instant tmux Notifications (Real-Time Alerts)

For when agents need immediate attention:

```bash
# Urgent alert - pops up in the target agent's terminal
send-tmux-message.sh backend-architect "üö® Production database down - check inbox!"
```

**Three delivery methods:**
- **`display`** - Non-intrusive popup (auto-dismisses)
- **`inject`** - Visible in terminal history
- **`echo`** - Formatted output for critical alerts

### Real-World Use Case

```bash
# Frontend agent working on user dashboard
# Backend agent finishes the API they need

# Backend sends structured message
send-aimaestro-message.sh frontend-dev \
  "User stats API ready" \
  "GET /api/stats implemented. Returns {activeUsers, signups, revenue}.
   Cached for 5min. Rate limited to 100/hour." \
  high \
  notification

# Backend also sends instant alert so frontend sees it immediately
send-tmux-message.sh frontend-dev "‚úÖ User stats API is ready - check inbox for details"

# Frontend agent checks inbox
check-and-show-messages.sh
# Sees the full message with context

# Frontend responds after integration
send-aimaestro-message.sh backend-architect \
  "Re: User stats API integrated" \
  "Dashboard updated. Works perfectly. Thanks!" \
  normal \
  response
```

### Claude Code Integration

Every agent session can use the messaging system automatically via a **Claude Code skill**:

```bash
# In any agent session, just say:
> "Send a message to backend-architect asking them to implement POST /api/users"

# Claude automatically:
# 1. Recognizes the messaging intent
# 2. Chooses appropriate method (file-based)
# 3. Sends message to backend-architect's inbox
# 4. Confirms delivery
```

**No manual scripting needed** - agents understand natural language messaging commands.

### Built-In UI

Each session has a **Messages tab** with:
- üì• **Inbox** - See all messages sent to this agent
- üì§ **Sent** - Track what you've sent to other agents
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Compose** - Send new messages with priority/type selection
- üîî **Unread count** - Never miss important messages

### Get Started in 2 Minutes

```bash
# 1. Agents check inbox on session start
check-and-show-messages.sh

# 2. Send your first message
send-aimaestro-message.sh backend-api \
  "Test message" \
  "Hello from the communication system!" \
  normal \
  notification

# 3. Check for new messages
check-new-messages-arrived.sh
```

### Why This Matters

**Before:** You're the bottleneck. Every agent interaction goes through you.

**After:** Agents coordinate directly. You orchestrate, they collaborate.

**Result:** Faster development, better context retention, true multi-agent workflows.

## üéØ Why AI Maestro?

**Problem**: Managing multiple AI agents is chaotic.
**Solution**: One dashboard to rule them all.

**Why not just use tmux directly?**
You can! AI Maestro is built on tmux. But instead of memorizing keybindings and switching between panes, you get:
- Visual organization
- Point-and-click switching
- Persistent notes
- Beautiful UI

**Is it just a tmux GUI?**
Think of it as tmux + organization + notes + visual hierarchy. You still have full access to your tmux sessions from the terminal.

---

## üìã Requirements

- **macOS 12.0+** (Monterey or later)
- **Node.js 18.17+**
- **tmux 3.0+**
- **Your favorite AI agent** (Claude, Aider, Cursor, Copilot, etc.)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Built with modern, battle-tested tools:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React 18, Tailwind CSS
- **Terminal**: xterm.js with WebGL acceleration

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Security

**‚ö†Ô∏è Network Access Enabled by Default**

AI Maestro runs on `0.0.0.0:23000` which means:
- ‚úÖ **Accessible from any device on your local network**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No authentication required** - anyone on your WiFi can access it
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Unencrypted connections** (ws://) - data sent in plain text
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Full terminal access** - anyone connected can run commands

**Safe for:**
- Home networks (trusted WiFi)
- Private office networks
- Development on trusted LANs

**NOT safe for:**
- Public WiFi (coffee shops, airports, etc.)
- Shared office WiFi with untrusted users
- Exposing port 23000 to the internet

---

#### üîí Localhost-Only Mode (Recommended for Maximum Security)

For the most secure setup, restrict AI Maestro to only accept connections from your local machine:

**Option 1: One-time run**
```bash
HOSTNAME=localhost yarn dev
# or
HOSTNAME=127.0.0.1 yarn dev
```

**Option 2: Persistent configuration** (recommended)

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```bash
# .env.local
HOSTNAME=localhost
PORT=23000
```

Then run normally:
```bash
yarn dev
```

**Production build:**
```bash
HOSTNAME=localhost yarn build
HOSTNAME=localhost yarn start
```

---

#### üåê Network Configuration Options

| Configuration | Access Level | Use Case |
|--------------|--------------|----------|
| `HOSTNAME=localhost` | **Local machine only** | Maximum security, single developer |
| `HOSTNAME=127.0.0.1` | **Local machine only** | Same as localhost (explicit IP) |
| `HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0` (default) | **Local network** | Access from phone/tablet/other computers |
| `HOSTNAME=192.168.x.x` | **Specific network interface** | Control which network accepts connections |

**Testing your configuration:**

```bash
# After starting the server, test access:

# Should always work (local access)
curl http://localhost:23000

# Will only work if HOSTNAME is 0.0.0.0 or your local IP
curl http://192.168.1.100:23000  # Replace with your machine's IP
```

---

#### üìù Session Logging Configuration

**Session Logging (Disabled by Default)**

AI Maestro can optionally log terminal session content to `./logs/{sessionName}.txt` files. This is useful for:
- üìä Reviewing AI agent conversations
- üêõ Debugging issues after sessions end
- üìñ Creating documentation from agent interactions
- üîç Searching through past work

**What gets logged:**
- ‚úÖ All terminal output and commands
- ‚úÖ AI agent responses and reasoning
- üö´ Filtered out: Claude Code status updates and thinking steps (reduces noise)
- üö´ Not logged: Browser notes (stored in localStorage only)

**Controls:**

1. **Global master switch** (in `.env.local`):
```bash
# Enable session logging
ENABLE_LOGGING=true

# Disable all session logging (default)
ENABLE_LOGGING=false
```

2. **Per-session toggle**: Each terminal has a üìù/üö´ button in the header to enable/disable logging for that specific session

**Privacy considerations:**
- Log files are stored locally only (`./logs/` directory)
- Logs are gitignored by default (never committed to git)
- No logs are sent over the network
- Logs contain whatever commands and data you run in terminals
- Consider disabling logging when working with sensitive data

**Disk usage:**
- Log files grow with session activity
- No automatic cleanup or rotation (manage manually)
- Disable logging globally or per-session to save disk space

---

#### üõ°Ô∏è Additional Security Measures

**Built-in protections:**
- No data sent over the internet (runs 100% locally)
- Notes stored in browser localStorage only
- tmux sessions run with your user permissions
- No external API calls or telemetry

**Recommended practices:**
- Use localhost-only mode when on untrusted networks
- Never expose port 23000 to the internet (no port forwarding)
- Review tmux session permissions regularly
- Consider using a firewall to restrict port 23000 access

**‚ö†Ô∏è Not for production use** without adding:
- Authentication (user login)
- HTTPS/WSS encryption
- Rate limiting
- Access logging

### Known Limitations

#### Scrollback with Claude Code
When Claude Code updates status indicators (like "Thinking..."), you may see duplicate lines in the scrollback buffer. This is a known limitation of xterm.js (the terminal library used by VS Code, JupyterLab, and most web terminals).

**Why this happens:**
- Native terminals (iTerm2, Terminal.app) only add content to scrollback when it scrolls off the top
- xterm.js records every cursor movement, including in-place status updates
- Claude Code uses cursor positioning to update indicators, creating intermediate states in scrollback

**Workarounds included:**
- üßπ **Clear button** in terminal header - manually clean scrollback when needed
- **No history replay** - start with clean terminal on reconnect
- These are the same workarounds used by other xterm.js-based terminals

**Note:** This is not specific to AI Maestro - it affects all web terminals using xterm.js with tools that update status indicators in place.

### Compatibility
- Works with **any** terminal-based AI agent
- Not affiliated with Anthropic, OpenAI, GitHub, or any AI provider
- Each AI agent requires separate installation/authentication
