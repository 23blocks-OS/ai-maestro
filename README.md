## The Problem

You're using Claude Code for backend, Aider for frontend, and Cursor for docs. Each in its own terminal window. Each in a different tmux pane. You're constantly switching contexts, losing track of which agent is where, and your terminal tabs look like chaos.

## The Solution

![AI Maestro Dashboard](./docs/images/aiteam-web.png)

AI Maestro gives you one beautiful web dashboard for all your AI coding agents. Click between sessions instantly. Organize them hierarchically. Take notes. Never lose track again.

---

## ‚ú® Features

### Universal Agent Support
Works with **any** terminal-based AI:
- Claude Code
- Aider
- Cursor
- GitHub Copilot CLI
- OpenAI Codex
- Your custom AI scripts

### Smart Organization
- **3-level hierarchy**: Use hyphens to create structure (e.g., `project-category-agent`)
- **Dynamic color coding**: Each top-level category gets its own color automatically
- **Visual hierarchy**: Expandable accordion with icons
- **Auto-grouping**: Sessions with hyphens are automatically organized
- **Instant search**: Find any session immediately *(coming in v1.1)*

### Session Management
- **Create** sessions from the UI
- **Rename** with a click
- **Delete** when done
- **Notes** for each session (auto-saved to localStorage)
- **Auto-discovery**: Detects all your tmux sessions automatically

### Built for Speed
- WebSocket streaming for real-time terminal I/O
- No lag, no polling
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Native macOS performance

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install & Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/23blocks-OS/ai-maestro.git
cd ai-maestro
yarn install
```

**Configure tmux for optimal scrolling** (highly recommended):
```bash
./scripts/setup-tmux.sh
```

This enables:
- ‚úÖ Mouse wheel scrolling (works with Claude Code's alternate screen)
- ‚úÖ 50,000 line scrollback buffer (up from 2,000)
- ‚úÖ Better terminal colors

**Start the dashboard**:
```bash
yarn dev
```

Dashboard opens at `http://localhost:23000`

**Network Access:** By default, AI Maestro is accessible on your local network at port 23000. See [Security](#security) below for important information.

**Optional: Configure security settings**
```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local to change HOSTNAME to 'localhost' for local-only access
# See the Security section below for all configuration options
```

### 2. Create Your First Session

**Option A: From the UI** (Recommended)

1. Click the **"+" button** in the sidebar
2. Enter a session name using hyphens for hierarchy:
   - Simple: `my-project`
   - Organized: `myproject-backend-api` (creates 3 levels)
3. Choose your working directory
4. Click "Create Agent"
5. Start your AI agent in the terminal that appears

**Option B: From Terminal** (For tmux users)

```bash
# In another terminal
cd ~/my-project
tmux new-session -s myproject-backend-api

# Start your AI agent (claude, aider, cursor, copilot, etc.)
claude

# Detach: Ctrl+B then D
```

> **üí° Hierarchy Tip**: Session names with hyphens create automatic organization:
> - `project-backend` ‚Üí 2 levels (project > backend)
> - `project-backend-api` ‚Üí 3 levels (project > backend > api)
> - Each top level gets its own color automatically!

### 3. Start Coding

Your session is now live in the dashboard. Click to switch between sessions. Add notes. Organize your work. That's it.

## üì∏ Screenshots

<details>
<summary><b>Hierarchical Session Organization</b></summary>

Sessions organized automatically using hyphens, with color coding and icons:

**Example session names:**
- `fluidmind-agents-backend-architect`
- `fluidmind-agents-frontend-developer`
- `fluidmind-experiments-api-tester`
- `ecommerce-development-cart-api`
- `ecommerce-development-checkout-flow`

**Displays as:**
```
üé® fluidmind (purple)
  üìÅ agents
    ü§ñ backend-architect
    ü§ñ frontend-developer
  üìÅ experiments
    üß™ api-tester

üõí ecommerce (blue)
  üìÅ development
    üíª cart-api
    üíª checkout-flow
```

Each top-level category gets a unique color automatically - no configuration needed.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Session Notes</b></summary>

Take notes for each session. They're saved automatically to your browser:
- Track architectural decisions
- Save commands for later
- Keep TODO lists
- Leave context for tomorrow

</details>

## üéØ Why AI Maestro?

**Problem**: Managing multiple AI agents is chaotic.
**Solution**: One dashboard to rule them all.

**Why not just use tmux directly?**
You can! AI Maestro is built on tmux. But instead of memorizing keybindings and switching between panes, you get:
- Visual organization
- Point-and-click switching
- Persistent notes
- Beautiful UI

**Is it just a tmux GUI?**
Think of it as tmux + organization + notes + visual hierarchy. You still have full access to your tmux sessions from the terminal.

## üìã Requirements

- **macOS 12.0+** (Monterey or later)
- **Node.js 18.17+**
- **tmux 3.0+**
- **Your favorite AI agent** (Claude, Aider, Cursor, Copilot, etc.)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Security

**‚ö†Ô∏è Network Access Enabled by Default**

AI Maestro runs on `0.0.0.0:23000` which means:
- ‚úÖ **Accessible from any device on your local network**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No authentication required** - anyone on your WiFi can access it
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Unencrypted connections** (ws://) - data sent in plain text
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Full terminal access** - anyone connected can run commands

**Safe for:**
- Home networks (trusted WiFi)
- Private office networks
- Development on trusted LANs

**NOT safe for:**
- Public WiFi (coffee shops, airports, etc.)
- Shared office WiFi with untrusted users
- Exposing port 23000 to the internet

---

#### üîí Localhost-Only Mode (Recommended for Maximum Security)

For the most secure setup, restrict AI Maestro to only accept connections from your local machine:

**Option 1: One-time run**
```bash
HOSTNAME=localhost yarn dev
# or
HOSTNAME=127.0.0.1 yarn dev
```

**Option 2: Persistent configuration** (recommended)

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```bash
# .env.local
HOSTNAME=localhost
PORT=23000
```

Then run normally:
```bash
yarn dev
```

**Production build:**
```bash
HOSTNAME=localhost yarn build
HOSTNAME=localhost yarn start
```

---

#### üåê Network Configuration Options

| Configuration | Access Level | Use Case |
|--------------|--------------|----------|
| `HOSTNAME=localhost` | **Local machine only** | Maximum security, single developer |
| `HOSTNAME=127.0.0.1` | **Local machine only** | Same as localhost (explicit IP) |
| `HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0` (default) | **Local network** | Access from phone/tablet/other computers |
| `HOSTNAME=192.168.x.x` | **Specific network interface** | Control which network accepts connections |

**Testing your configuration:**

```bash
# After starting the server, test access:

# Should always work (local access)
curl http://localhost:23000

# Will only work if HOSTNAME is 0.0.0.0 or your local IP
curl http://192.168.1.100:23000  # Replace with your machine's IP
```

---

#### üõ°Ô∏è Additional Security Measures

**Built-in protections:**
- No data sent over the internet (runs 100% locally)
- Notes stored in browser localStorage only
- tmux sessions run with your user permissions
- No external API calls or telemetry

**Recommended practices:**
- Use localhost-only mode when on untrusted networks
- Never expose port 23000 to the internet (no port forwarding)
- Review tmux session permissions regularly
- Consider using a firewall to restrict port 23000 access

**‚ö†Ô∏è Not for production use** without adding:
- Authentication (user login)
- HTTPS/WSS encryption
- Rate limiting
- Access logging

### Compatibility
- Works with **any** terminal-based AI agent
- Not affiliated with Anthropic, OpenAI, GitHub, or any AI provider
- Each AI agent requires separate installation/authentication
