- **Task**: This is an AI Maestro project (Next.js). Find ALL occurrences of the old marketplace name 'ai-maestro-local-marketplace' in each file. Also find any occurrences of the even older name 'role-plugins' used as a marketplace name (NOT as a directory path or URL path segment — only when used as a marketplace identifier/name string). Report the exact line number and the full line content for each occurrence. If a file has zero occurrences, skip it entirely — do not report clean files.
